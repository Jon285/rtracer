# RTRACER

A basic raytracer written in Rust following the ["Computer Graphics From
Scratch"](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/introduction.html)
series,
plus some more addition, like a bit more of abstraction, multithreading and my ~~bad~~
idiomatic code.

## TODOs
* More objects (cubes, ~~planes~~, cylinders, triangles, etc)
* Bounding Volume Hierarchy
* Free camera
* Anti-Aliasing
* Global Illumination
* Transparency and Refraction
* Constructive Solid Geometry

A traced image, the code creates ~~PPM images that I converted externaly to PNG to post here.~~ now can create PNG, JPEG and any other format the image crate supports!
