# RTRACER

A basic raytracer written in Rust following the ["Computer Graphics From
Scratch"](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/introduction.html)
series,
plus some more addition, like a bit more of abstraction, multithreading and my ~~bad~~
idiomatic code.

A traced image, the code create PPM images, I converted externaly to PNG to post here.
